## Companion Project: `AuthEllo`

User management (creating, updating, and deleting users and their route-based permissions) is handled by a separate
companion project, `AuthEllo`. This project follows a GitOps workflow, where changes to a `users.mjs` file in a
repository automatically trigger a secure hydration of your Cloudflare KV store.
