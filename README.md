# üõ°Ô∏è Authio: Pluggable Authentication & Authorization for Cloudflare Workers

Authio is a standalone, zero-dependency RPC service that provides a complete solution for authentication (AuthN) and
authorization (AuthZ) for your applications running on Cloudflare Workers.

It is designed to be a decoupled, high-performance service that you interact with via a **Service Binding**, allowing
you to manage users and permissions without redeploying your main application.

## üöÄ Full Documentation

This project is a standalone RPC service and is consumed by a parent worker. For complete information on features,
setup, configuration, and API usage, please see the comprehensive documentation in the `/docs` directory.

## Companion Project: `AuthEllo`

User management (creating, updating, and deleting users and their route-based permissions) is handled by a separate
companion project, `AuthEllo`. This project follows a GitOps workflow, where changes to a `users.mjs` file in a
repository automatically trigger a secure hydration of your Cloudflare KV store.
