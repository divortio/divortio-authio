# Authio: Pluggable Authentication & Authorization for Cloudflare Workers

Authio is a self-contained, zero-dependency module that provides a comprehensive solution for authentication (AuthN) and
authorization (AuthZ) within Cloudflare Workers. It is designed for both simplicity and extensibility, offering a
secure, stateless, and high-performance way to protect your applications and APIs.

By leveraging JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and a user store managed in Cloudflare KV, Authio allows you to decouple user
management from your application logic, enabling updates without requiring new deployments.
